    "text": "Abstract\nCaffeine is one of the most commonly consumed legal drugs on the market, boasting various effects ranging from improved physiological capabilities to addictions. This investigative project challenges the validity of popular claims that caffeine can improve mental performance such as increasing a person’s attention span. A simulated island population was utilized to research the effects of caffeine with a Replicated Latin Square Design to experiment. 63 participants were selected to participate in the study and were assigned one of 3 levels of caffeine, and each participant underwent a 10-minute attention test before and after taking their assigned amount of caffeine. The differences in their test results were compared, and these differences found that caffeine did not have a significant effect on any participant’s attention test scores. Caffeine has many known practical and popular uses in consumer products, but it may not be suitable for maintaining a person’s attention span. Further research is recommended to ascertain caffeine’s exact benefits and drawbacks. As with any drug, caffeine should be consumed in moderation, and consumers using caffeine as a performance enhancer should ensure to consume caffeine for the appropriate tasks."

    "text": "When I was growing up, I thought math was useless. The math lovers around me struggled to demonstrate the practicality of math. They would flaunt their formulas used to calculate which water pressure regulator to install on a pipe while forgetting that water pressure varies with temperature. The pipe would explode, and I would trudge through the cold winter to fix the pipe, contemplating how math was useless.\nMy mindset changed in college where my mathematics professors showed me that that mathematics was not as limited as I had previously been shown, and it was through the encouragement of my professors that I became interested in data science. The more I learned about statistics and data science, the more I realized how numbers were not abstract theories but powerful tools that drive impactful decision making.\nI have a nontraditional journey to higher education. I left school at 12 to train for a path I didn’t ultimately pursue, but it gave me many unique experiences and took me to many places across the globe such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Tahiti. In addition to my primary language, English, I picked up Mandarin and Cantonese while abroad, thus training strong adaptability and a keen eye for patterns.\nNow, I specialize in using statistical methods through R, Python, and SQL to analyze data for informed data-driven decision making. My nontraditional global background gives me a flexible and resourceful problem-solving mindset, and my strong work ethic ensures I’m always willing to put in the effort to learn and grow."

In examining the impact of Airbnb’s operation on the socioeconomic aspects of London and New York City, this project aimed to uncover the key differences between these two influential cities. A particular interest was aimed in understanding how regulatory adjustments have influenced the supply and demand for short-term rentals and, subsequently, how these changes affect affordability and housing availability."

    "text": "Abstract\nThis analysis aims to explore patterns in voting behavior using demographic and social attitude data. Utilizing logistic regression and random forest, we identified variables such as higher education levels, support for legal abortion, and belief in climate change as positively associated with voting Democratic, while better financial situations and Christian religious affiliations were negatively associated with voting Democratic. A model with 6 predictors was determined to be most applicable with a prediction accuracy 85% and a ROC AUC score of 0.91. Future efforts should focus on standardizing survey questions to minimize the number of survey versions and and increase effective sample size and representation which will improve model accuracy."
