    "text": "Abstract\nThis analysis aims to explore patterns in voting behavior using demographic and social attitude data. Utilizing logistic regression and random forest, we identified variables such as higher education levels, support for legal abortion, and belief in climate change as positively associated with voting Democratic, while better financial situations and Christian religious affiliations were negatively associated with voting Democratic. A model with 6 predictors was determined to be most applicable with a prediction accuracy of 85% and a ROC AUC score of 0.91. Future efforts should focus on standardizing survey questions to minimize the number of survey versions and and increase effective sample size and representation which will improve model accuracy."

In examining the impact of Airbnb’s operation on the socioeconomic aspects of London and New York City, this project aimed to uncover the key differences between these two influential cities. A particular interest was aimed in understanding how regulatory adjustments have influenced the supply and demand for short-term rentals and, subsequently, how these changes affect affordability and housing availability."

    "text": "Abstract\nCaffeine is one of the most commonly consumed legal drugs on the market, boasting various effects ranging from improved physiological capabilities to addictions. This investigative project challenges the validity of popular claims that caffeine can improve mental performance such as increasing a person’s attention span. A simulated island population was utilized to research the effects of caffeine with a Replicated Latin Square Design to experiment. 63 participants were selected to participate in the study and were assigned one of 3 levels of caffeine, and each participant underwent a 10-minute attention test before and after taking their assigned amount of caffeine. The differences in their test results were compared, and these differences found that caffeine did not have a significant effect on any participant’s attention test scores. Caffeine has many known practical and popular uses in consumer products, but it may not be suitable for maintaining a person’s attention span. Further research is recommended to ascertain caffeine’s exact benefits and drawbacks. As with any drug, caffeine should be consumed in moderation, and consumers using caffeine as a performance enhancer should ensure to consume caffeine for the appropriate tasks."

    "text": "Abstract\nThis report investigates the impact of COVID-19 lockdown policies on spending, and whether said policies impacted the economic recovery of a city. We chose to focus on New York City, New York, a state that enforced a mandatory lockdown, and Omaha, Nebraska, a state that did not issue any stay-at-home or complete lockdown orders. This report uses data from the Opportunity Insights data tracker, a non-partisan, not-for-profit organization located at Harvard University. In order to conduct this analysis, we created several time series plots and conducted t-tests using our chosen variables. We found that spending overall was significantly different in the two cities – spending in arts and entertainment decreased while grocery spending increased in New York City, and arts spending increased while grocery spending remained unaffected in Omaha. Our t-tests indicate a significant difference as well, with a p-value \\(&lt; 0.05\\). In conjunction, our t-tests and time series plots both suggest a rejection of the null hypothesis, thus, we conclude that lockdown policies have an impact on spending. However, due to our limiting factors (mainly the confounding variables which occur due to the differences in population, primary industry, and other aspects of the two cities), we are unable to concretely determine the exact impact lockdown policies have. Still, we believe our analysis could result in useful contributions regarding policy decisions, namely the impact that national disasters may have on spending and potential areas of impact to focus on."
