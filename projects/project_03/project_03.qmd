## Abstract

This analysis aims to explore patterns in voting behavior using demographic and social attitude data. Utilizing logistic regression and random forest, we identified variables such as higher education levels, support for legal abortion, and belief in climate change as positively associated with voting Democratic, while better financial situations and Christian religious affiliations were negatively associated with voting Democratic. A model with 6 predictors was determined to be most applicable with a prediction accuracy of 85% and a ROC AUC score of 0.91. Future efforts should focus on standardizing survey questions to minimize the number of survey versions and and increase effective sample size and representation which will improve model accuracy.
